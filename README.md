## Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide a quickstart for creating nOS dApps with various frontend technologies already installed and configured to work with the nOS platform.


## Installation
Before we start, we want to make sure npm is installed via a version manager. To avoid permission issues on different OS, we suggest using nvm. You can follow the install instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#using-a-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm).

After successfully installing npm, we need to install the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nosplatform/create-nos-dapp). This will make the `create-nos-dapp` command available in your command prompt. You can install the npm package by executing one of the following commands

```
# Using yarn
yarn global add @nosplatform/create-nos-dapp

# Using npm
npm i -g @nosplatform/create-nos-dapp
```

---

## Usage

#### Direct usage
At this point the `create-nos-dapp` command should be available. To create a dApp for nOS, simply open up your command prompt and execute:
```
create-nos-dapp
```

It will now ask you to choose a project template and what name you'd like to give it. The CLI-tool will create the project in the current working directory. 

#### Usage with flags

If you'd like to get started even faster - you could also pass some arguments to the `create-nos-dapp`.
```
usage: create-nos-dapp [-h] [-v] [-t TYPE] [-n NAME]

create-nos-dapp

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -v, --version         Show program's version number and exit.
  -t TYPE, --type TYPE  Template type (react/vanilla/vue)
  -n NAME, --name NAME  Project name, f.e. my-nos-dapp
```
